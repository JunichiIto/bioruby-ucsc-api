== Features

* Designed as a BioRuby plugin
* Using the Bin index system to improve query performance (see https://github.com/misshie/UCSCBin )
* Automatic conversion of "1-based full-closed intervals" to internal "0-based half-closed intervals" (see also bioruby-genomic-interval)
* Supporting non-official MySql hosts (e.g. local servers)
* Using Rspec for the testing framework
* Trying to support whole hg19 and hg18 databases.

 Bio::Ucsc::Hg19::Snp131.find_by_interval(itv).each do |e|
   i = Bio::GenomicInterval.zero_based(e.chrom, e.chromStart, e.chromEnd)
   puts "#{i.chrom}\t#{i.chromStart}\t#{e.name}\t#{e[:class]}"
