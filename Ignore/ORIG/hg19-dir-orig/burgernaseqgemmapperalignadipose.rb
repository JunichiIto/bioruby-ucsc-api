# RNA-Seq is a method for mapping and quantifying the transcriptome of
# any organism that has a genomic DNA sequence assembly. RNA-Seq was
# performed by reverse-transcribing an RNA sample into cDNA, followed
# by high throughput DNA sequencing on an Illumina Genome
# Analyser. This track shows the RNA-seq data published by Chris
# Burge's lab (Wang et al.,2008) mapped to the genome using GEM Mapper
# by the Guig√≥ lab at the Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG). The
# subtracks display RNA-seq data from various tissues/cell lines
#
# = ommitted dynamic method(s) due to the method name collision
