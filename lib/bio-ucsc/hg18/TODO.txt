#TODO: The repeatmasker features are distributed over different tables; one for
#      each chromosome.
#    # = DESCRIPTION
#    # From RepeatMasker description page when clicking the "Describe 
#    # table schema" in the table browser:
#    # "This track was created by using Arian Smit's RepeatMasker program, which 
#    # screens DNA sequences for interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA 
#    # sequences. The program outputs a detailed annotation of the repeats that 
#    # are present in the query sequence, as well as a modified version of the 
#    # query sequence in which all the annotated repeats have been masked. 
#    # RepeatMasker uses the RepBase library of repeats from the Genetic 
#    # Information Research Institute (GIRI). RepBase is described in Jurka, J. 
#    # (2000) in the References section below."
